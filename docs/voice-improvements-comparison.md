## 💬 Command Understanding

### BEFORE ❌
**Limited to 5 rigid commands:**
- "Create course" → Basic pattern match
- "Assign teacher" → Basic pattern match
- "Upload files" → Basic pattern match
- "Analyze course" → Basic pattern match
- "Help" → Canned response

**Example failures:**
- ❌ "I need to build a Python course" → Not recognized
- ❌ "Who's the best teacher for React?" → Not recognized
- ❌ "Show me student progress" → Not recognized
- ❌ "Generate reports on course performance" → Not recognized

### AFTER ✅
**10+ categories with natural language understanding:**
- Course creation
- Teacher management
- Content development
- Student management
- Analysis & reports
- Planning & scheduling
- File management
- Content creation
- General queries
- And MORE!

**Example successes:**
- ✅ "I need to build a Python course" → Creates course
- ✅ "Who's the best teacher for React?" → Finds teacher
- ✅ "Show me student progress" → Opens student management
- ✅ "Generate reports on course performance" → Creates reports
- ✅ "Help me write course material about databases" → Content assistance
- ✅ "Schedule classes for next semester" → Planning assistance
- ✅ ANYTHING ELSE → AI processes and handles it!
